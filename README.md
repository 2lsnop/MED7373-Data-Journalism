## Module Synopsis

Data Journalism aims to facilitate a flexible and adaptable skillset, including the use of ‘computational thinking’ and communities of practice, that provides a basis for students to critically adapt to both new and existing data journalism techniques.

You will also be learning about other aspects of data journalism in sister modules, for example [the **Narrative** module](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7334-Narrative/blob/master/README.md) will give you a range of skills for telling data-driven stories using video, audio, visual journalism, visualisation, and interactivity. In **Research in Practice** you will explore research around newsrooms. In **Specialist Reporting, Investigations and Coding** you will expand your coding and investigative skills, and in **Law, ethics, regulation and security** you will build your infosec skills.


## Outcomes

1. Identify, gather and communicate stories based on structured information using data journalism techniques and technologies for an identified audience
2.	Critically evaluate the professional, legal and ethical contexts surrounding data journalism and apply that to a specific project

## Week by week outline

This module begins with formal classes and becomes more student-driven as it progresses. You will be expected to **listen to class podcasts and screencasts ahead of most sessions**, so that class time is spent more fruitfully in interactive discussion rather than one-way lectures.

You will also be expected to feed your own experiences into each class - and your own problems and questions - rather than coming to the sessions with nothing to contribute or build on. As independent learners the emphasis is on you to drive your learning forward through conversation rather than accept it passively.

## Week 1: Data journalism's 3 chords

By the end of this week you should be able to use core spreadsheet techniques to find stories, including sorting and filtering, pivot tables, and be able to calculate change and proportions. You will also be able to use GitHub to clone or fork a repo.

* Workshop: [Fork this repo!](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/tree/master/week1) Data journalism basics: sorting, filtering, pivot tables, calculations
* Task: Data journalism critique; practise spreadsheet skills

## Week 2: How to think like a data journalist: data literacy and algorithmic and computational thinking

By the end of this week you should be able to use a range of spreadsheet functions - but more importantly, use computational thinking to break down editorial challenges into problems that can be tackled systematically, quickly and effectively, with the potential for automation or semi-automation as algorithms.

* Workshop: [The postcode challenge](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7373-Data-Journalism/tree/master/week2)
* Task: Identify story ideas/leads and break down the tasks needed to achieve those

## Week 3: Mobile first: responsive and mobile UX

By the end of this week you should be able to create a basic HTML page with CSS styles, and explain the basics of design for mobile devices.

*Before the class*: read Learning HTML and CSS by making tweetable quotes on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/learninghtmlandcss) or [OJB](https://onlinejournalismblog.com/2015/02/09/how-to-learn-html-and-css-by-making-tweetable-quotes/)

* Reading: Jeremy Keith: [Resilient Web Design](https://resilientwebdesign.com/)

## Week 4: Visualisation and interactivity

By the end of this week you should be able to explain basic concepts in JavaScript and use it to create basic interactivity and/or visualisations. *Note: the [Narrative module](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/MED7334-Narrative) class on principles of visualisation and visual design, and the class on ergodic storytelling are particularly relevant to your work in this area*

* Workshop: JavaScript interactivity and vis: counters, quizzes, charts
* Task: Continued work on JavaScript

## Week 5: Bad data: data problems and solutions. Introduction to R

By the end of this week you should be able to identify common data problems, and use techniques to solve those. You should also be able to use basic data processing and analysis techniques in R.

* Workshop: Importing, analysing, and exporting in R ([Fork this repo!](https://github.com/paulbradshaw/rintro))
* Task: Use R to clean and check your data

## Week 6: Reading Week. No class.

During this week you should be consolidating your learning so far, developing your skills on one or more editorial project, reviewing examples of data journalism, and continuing to read widely around the subject.

## Week 7: APIs

By the end of this week you should be able to use a range of techniques for fetching data from APIs in both R and JavaScript, and explore possibilities for dynamically analysing and/or presenting that data.
