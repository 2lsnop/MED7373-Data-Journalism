## Module Synopsis

Data Journalism aims to facilitate a flexible and adaptable skillset, including the use of ‘computational thinking’ and communities of practice, that provides a basis for students to critically adapt to both new and existing data journalism techniques. 

## Outcomes

1. Identify, gather and communicate stories based on structured information using data journalism techniques and technologies for an identified audience
2.	Critically evaluate the professional, legal and ethical contexts surrounding data journalism and apply that to a specific project

## Week by week outline 

This module begins with formal classes and becomes more student-driven as it progresses. You will be expected to **listen to class podcasts and screencasts ahead of most sessions**, so that class time is spent more fruitfully in interactive discussion rather than one-way lectures. 

You will also be expected to feed your own experiences into each class - and your own problems and questions - rather than coming to the sessions with nothing to contribute or build on. As independent learners the emphasis is on you to drive your learning forward through conversation rather than accept it passively.

## Week 1: Data journalism's 3 chords

By the end of this week you should be able to use core spreadsheet techniques to find stories, including sorting and filtering, pivot tables, and be able to calculate change and proportions. You will also be able to use GitHub to clone or fork a repo.

* Workshop: Fork this repo! Data journalism basics: sorting, filtering, pivot tables, calculations 
* Task: Fork and edit an FOI request using GitHub. Data journalism critique.

## Week 2: How to think like a data journalist: data literacy and algorithmic and computational thinking

By the end of this week you should be able to use a range of spreadsheet functions - but more importantly, use computational thinking to break down editorial challenges into problems that can be tackled systematically, quickly and effectively, with the potential for automation or semi-automation as algorithms.
