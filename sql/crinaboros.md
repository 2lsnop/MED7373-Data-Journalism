Download [DB Browser for SQLite](https://sqlitebrowser.org/) or [SQLite Database Browser New](https://sourceforge.net/projects/sqlitedbrowser/?source=typ_redirect).

To deal with larger datasets try [Microsoft SQL Server Management Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/download-sql-server-management-studio-ssms?view=sql-server-2017).

SQL:

* Analysis does not change the tables

## Key commands and order:

```
SELECT
FROM
  JOIN ... ON
