# Storytelling with data

## Case study 1: railway station usage figures

The Office of Rail and Road releases ["Estimates of station usage"](http://orr.gov.uk/statistics/published-stats/station-usage-estimates) each year around early December - although many journalists will only [look at the press release](http://orr.gov.uk/news-and-media/press-releases/2014/waterloo-remains-britains-most-heavily-used-station) that it sounds out with the figures. 

It's helpful to look at how different news organisations react to the statistics and the decisions they make about how to report it, as well as how journalists use the data in less time-pressured contexts.

Below are some examples with notes:

#### BBC: [Revealed: Britain's busiest and quietest stations](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-35105105)

The key verb in the headline - and most others - is 'revealed'. The newness of the story is that new figures have been released, so the intro needs to back that up. 

As is common practice, the intro merely repeats the headline with a few extra words, and switches into past tense: "Britain's busiest and quietest railway stations have been revealed in figures from the rail regulator."

Note that the source is kept general: “figures from the rail regulator” - no need to name in the first par: the full name can be used later, when a little extra detail is given about the report (in par 5).

There are actually two stories here (possibly three if you consider the lists as a separate feature). After the news article has finished, the report moves on to a more in-depth report **By David Keller, BBC East of England**. 

This is written in the first person ("I'll never forget") and includes quotes - he has sought a reaction from stakeholders in this story: the Campaign for Better Transport group, and - because those are critical - a response to *that* from the Department for Transport and Rail Delivery Group. Note that these quotes don't really connect with the criticisms: it is quite common for large organisations to merely state the 'party line' in response to a request for comment. A good journalist would push on this, or at least draw attention to the fact that the organisation "failed to respond directly to the criticisms but said...".

The reason for the shift from one story to another is that the reporting has been done by a broadcast journalist, and the article as a whole is following broadcast conventions rather than print or online ones: after the 'straight' news story is reported we 'cut' to the reporter (imagine them on the scene at a railway station) who starts his narration with a bit of personal colour. Broadcast journalism tends to use first person reporting a lot more than text-based reporting - after all, you cannot hide a reporter who is stood in front of a camera! It also tends to rely more on interviews: chances are that the quotes used in this second part were taken from a broadcast report made by David Keller.

A final note: images are used throughout the piece. Don't forget these!

#### The Telegraph: [Revealed: The 10 busiest and 10 quietest railway stations in Britain](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/12052797/Revealed-The-10-busiest-and-10-quietest-railway-stations-in-Britain.html)

A very similar approach to the BBC, for reasons that will become apparent...

Note that the Telegraph use a 'sub-headline' between the headline and the intro - this isn't the style in most publications but you need to consider what style yours uses.

The source this time isn't mentioned until par 2 - it's not important enough to go in the first par. And it is kept general again: “Figures from the rail regulator”.

By par 4 there's a shift to mention the reaction to the figures, although this really needs to be backed up with some quotes. Instead, the only quote we get is a secondary one: "A Department for Transport spokesman told the BBC..."

In fact, if you look at the BBC report you will see that this story is really mostly a **rewrite** of the BBC story with no original reporting: the sentence "Campaigners and industry groups said the report highlighted the impact of station facilities on footfall" is copied word-for-word. This might be done in the industry but **don't do this in your assignments**: it is plagiarism and will be treated very seriously.

#### Evening Standard: [Revealed: UK's busiest train stations as Waterloo named top with 99m journeys](https://www.standard.co.uk/news/transport/revealed-uks-busiest-train-stations-and-how-many-are-in-london-a3708276.html)

**Audience** is important to highlight here: the Evening Standard is a London newspaper, not a national one, so its focus is explicitly on London.

Note that there are no quotes - this isn't ideal, but it is a quick turnaround piece and on an uncontroversial subject. You can always add quotes later if it's online.

Note that the article does, however, answer at least one 'why' question: "because of engineering works which saw part of the route closed for four months."

This story uses the image provided by ORR - other organisations chose not to. This depends on whether the image matches the story you are telling.

#### Global Railway Review: [Waterloo is ‘Top of the Stops’ for Great Britain’s rail stations](https://www.globalrailwayreview.com/news/64645/waterloo-top-rail-stations/)

This is a **specialist** publication, so its audience is people already interested in railways. It is written quite dryly (and frankly not very well): "*With a total of 99,403,096 entries and exits in 2016/17*..." is a horrible way to begin a story - we are bored before we reach the end of the sentence. 

One of the problems is the level of detail: forcing people to read 8 separate digits is asking a lot - it is generally better to round figures and instead report "over 99 million" or "close to 100 million" when dealing with such large figures.

One good thing it does is **link** to an interactive graphic - but the link is too general: http://orr.gov.uk/statistics/popular-statistics doesn't take us to the graphic itself but a general page for charts. Which one did it mean? It would have been better to link specifically to that one.

You might argue that you can be more dry with a specialist audience but there's still a lot that this piece could learn from the other articles listed here.

#### The Guardian: [Every train station in Britain listed and mapped: find out how busy each one is](https://www.theguardian.com/news/datablog/2011/may/19/train-stations-listed-rail)

This one is from 2013 but represents a data-centric approach from The Guardian's pioneering Datablog. The verbs in the headline are 'listed and mapped' and it also features a **call to action**: 'find out'

The focus here is on what the newspaper itself has done with the data (note: newspaper, not journalist - there's no first-person reporting here). 

The novelty - the newness - in this story is that it has been mapped. This was more newsworthy in 2013 than it would be now, when mapping and data journalism is more routine. But this approach can still work, and is also a good example of trying to involve users in journalism: the story ends with another call to action: "The full data is below. What can you do with it?"

#### BBC: [Shippea Hill station: How mince pies gave the least used station a boost](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42196835)

This story from the BBC England data unit takes the data as a starting point to find a more interesting story. Instead of reporting the same-old piece about Waterloo being top for the 14th year running, the reporter finds a quirkier tale behind the station with the biggest spike in usage.

This is a good example of being prepared to change your story as details emerge. In asking 'why' this station has had a big surge, he's found a better story than one which is purely about data. There's a celebrity aspect too, which helps.

## Data for context

In the BBC story [Commuters protest over Telford's MP's no demand for rail stations comment](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-42973820) the same data was used to provide factual context for a politician's claim that there was "no demand" for trains to stop at smaller stations. The story itself was about reaction to that claim, and this controversy needed some facts: who was right, the MP or the commuters?

Station usage allowed Dan Wainwright to add that crucial detail.

## Features

CityMetric's feature [A brief tour of Britain’s least used stations](https://www.citymetric.com/transport/brief-tour-britain-s-least-used-stations-teesside-4156) is a more leisurely journey through the entries at the bottom of the station usage dataset. The 'hook' in this story comes in par 3 - normally this should come earlier and I think this would benefit from some editing to make it sharper - but here it is anyway:

> "So where are these tiny stations? What purpose do they serve? And why should you definitely buy the first ticket out?"

The story makes good use of images - as a colour piece it would be poor if it didn't - but this story would be a lot better if the reporter had physically journeyed to these places and taken images specifically for the piece. 

Equally, it really lacks quotes: the reporter could have spoken to people who work at the stations, use them or live near them, to bring this piece to life (that could have been done via phone or email - although you always get better results in person). 

You could make this idea into a book, in fact, if done really well.



## Case study 2: Gender pay gap data

![](https://www.economist.com/sites/default/files/imagecache/640-width/20180407_WOC999.png)

News organisations have published a range of stories on gender pay gap data. You can [see an ongoing list of bookmarked examples here](https://pinboard.in/u:paulbradshaw/t:gender+dj+pay).

The stories are a good example of how the same data can be approached in different ways, and for different audiences. For example:

* Who's top/bottom: the simple first treatment, as in [this Guardian piece](https://www.theguardian.com/society/2018/apr/05/the-uk-companies-reporting-the-biggest-gender-pay-gaps)

* By industry: [Gender pay gap widening at one in four government bodies, figures show](https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2017/aug/10/gender-pay-gap-widening-at-one-in-four-government-bodies-figures-show) and [Gender pay gaps in academy school chains among the worst in UK](https://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/mar/25/gender-pay-gaps-in-academy-school-chains-among-the-worst-in-uk) focus on different sectors. [The Economist chart](https://www.economist.com/graphic-detail/2018/04/05/britains-gender-seniority-gap) shown above allows you to compare by sector, too.

* Make it personal: [Large companies have published their gender pay gap figures: How does yours compare?](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/03/22/large-companies-publishing-gender-pay-gap-figures-need-know/) and [Equal pay day: What is the gender pay gap like where you are?](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-41805053) offer a company and regional perspective respectively.

* Focus on a specific data point: you might pick a particular organisation and dig deeper into why they are such an outlier (or how they represent a 'typical' organisation)

* Do a video, or an explainer - or both: [this video explainer by The Guardian](https://www.theguardian.com/news/video/2018/apr/06/the-truth-about-gender-pay-gap-video-explainer?CMP=share_btn_tw) gives the subject something fresh

* Do a story about concerns over the quality of the data: [this BBC piece](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-42611365) does just that.

* Make it part of a bigger story, which is what [Woman's Hour did in this piece](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-41203240) on the best place to be a woman in Britain.

* Make a listicle:, for example [Gender pay gap: Six things we've learnt](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-43668187)
