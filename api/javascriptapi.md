# Working with an API in JavaScript

## Create some empty HTML to 'target' with JavaScript

First, we need an empty HTML table which is going to be filled with the data we're grabbing. It has some headings for each column, so you'll need to make sure those headings match with the data that you're about to grab. We've got 3 here:

```html
<table class="crimes">
  <tr>
    <th>category</th>
    <th>location</th>
    <th>street</th>
  </tr>
</table>
```

## Add the jQuery library



## Use `get` to grab the data from the API


## Specify what to do with `each` item of data from the API
