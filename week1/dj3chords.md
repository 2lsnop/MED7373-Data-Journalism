# Data journalism's 3 chords

Here's a quick activity to get to grips with data journalism's '3 chords': sorting, filtering, and calculating percentages (change and proportions).

With just those 3 tools you can find and tell the most basic data journalism stories: who's top and bottom; what's changed; and what's of interest.

## Some data to play with

First, you'll need some data to try out these techniques. Here are 3 useful datasets I'll refer to:

* [Local authority spending above Â£500 (Birmingham)](https://data.birmingham.gov.uk/dataset/payments-to-suppliers-over-f500) (the most recent release is at the bottom)
* [Stop and search data](https://data.police.uk/data/) (tick *West Midlands* and *Include stop and search data*)
* [European Investment Bank: projects financed database](http://www.eib.org/projects/loan/list/index.htm) (conduct a search and there will be a link to download the data)
* [Oscar winners](https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5To6f5Yj1iJVGJTekloX0o1dG8/view) (click the download button in the upper right corner)

Each has its own qualities that are useful to talk through as you work with the data and consider stories.

## Sorting



## Filtering

## Calculating percentages


## Data context: sense-checking

I said that each dataset had its own qualities. Here are some key points:

* The local authority data and stop and search is only one month. Remember that data like this may suffer from *seasonal variation*. For example, spending in April will be skewed by the fact that it is at the end of the financial year and some bills will only be settled in that month. Certain types of crime may increase at certain times of the year. Try to compare year-on-year rather than month-on-month to get a better comparison.

* The European Investment Bank data covers a long period of time, so loans made early in the time period will not be worth the same as loans of the same amount made later. In other words, you need to *account for inflation* if making long term comparisons.
