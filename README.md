## Module Synopsis

Data Journalism aims to facilitate a flexible and adaptable skillset, including the use of ‘computational thinking’ and communities of practice, that provides a basis for students to critically adapt to both new and existing data journalism techniques. 

## Outcomes

1. Identify, gather and communicate stories based on structured information using data journalism techniques and technologies for an identified audience
2.	Critically evaluate the professional, legal and ethical contexts surrounding data journalism and apply that to a specific project

## Week by week outline 

This module begins with formal classes and becomes more student-driven as it progresses. You will be expected to **listen to class podcasts and screencasts ahead of most sessions**, so that class time is spent more fruitfully in interactive discussion rather than one-way lectures. 

You will also be expected to feed your own experiences into each class - and your own problems and questions - rather than coming to the sessions with nothing to contribute or build on. As independent learners the emphasis is on you to drive your learning forward through conversation rather than accept it passively.
