# Fork this repo!

GitHub is widely used in data journalism for a number of reasons:

* As a way to show how you arrived at your findings (transparency, accountability)
* As a way to make it easy for others to collaborate with you (for example, they might create new visualisations or tools with the data, find new leads, or highlight problems)
* As a way to find useful tools and techniques
