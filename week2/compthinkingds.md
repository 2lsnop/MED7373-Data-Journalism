# Directed study: functions and computational thinking

This week you've been learning about **functions**, and how data journalists use computational thinking to break down problems, abstract them, identify patterns and solve them through a series of steps (algorithms). Now to put that into practice...

## Identify a story/dataset that presents a small challenge

One of the best ways to learn data journalism is to identify stories that need data journalism skills, but which aren't overly ambitious. Each project should stretch you a little further, and develop new skills.

Start, then, by identifying a dataset that you want to 'interview' for a story - or a story idea where you can find a relevant dataset. (Another example would be to identify some data you want to scrape, a visualisation challenge, or interactive tool - but those are for other classes).

## Break the challenge down into problems

Chances are that your story challenge is made up of more than one problem. Here are some examples:

In the BBC data unit's [baby names story](https://github.com/BBC-Data-Unit/baby-names-2017), we needed to:

1. Work out which name was the most popular for girls - and then do the same for boys
2. Work out which name was most popular in each region
3. Work out the names that had changed the most since 1996
4. Identify the popularity of recent celebrity names (film and TV characters, royals)
5. Calculate the number of names per 1,000 babies in each year since 1996



## Identify what you need to do - find functions that can do it

## Write up the process as a tutorial for others
