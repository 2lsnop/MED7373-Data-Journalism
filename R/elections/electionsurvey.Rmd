# Analysing the British Election Study

The British Election Study contains data on surveys of voters going back a number of years. The panel study is based on over 90,000 interviews and is supplied as a large file in the SPSS or STATA formats. 

R is well suited for dealing with both the format of the data, and its size.

[You can download any of the BES's panel studies as a large zip file here](https://www.britishelectionstudy.com/data-objects/panel-study-data/) - you may have to register for a free account first.
